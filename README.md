<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/hypetf/testt/blob/main/preview.png)

I have created this simple PHP authentication system as my first PHP project ever.<br/>
This was made to learn and develop my knowledge in this new field which would have been helpful to face the WorldSkills UK 2021 National Finals as it was required from a specific module.
